# ProgWeb-P01-2025
A clone of wanikani for a class I'm taking

Features I'm trying to implement:

-account registering

-SSRI Cards for japanese vocabulary learning

-individual progress tracking


Current:
-No back end yet, no registration
-click on login and type anything in to try a level (only level1 currently added)
